        "# Astro 528, Lab 2, Exercise 2\n\n## Numerical stability of N-body integrators\n\nAccording to our reading, one of the top priorities for scientific computing is numerical stability.  It can be hard to appreciate why numerical stability is important.  In order to illustrate the importance of numerical stability, we will consider a classic problem, integrating the trajectory of a star and planet interacting under Newtonian gravity.  \n\nThis can be expressed as integrating a set of $3N$ second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs).\n$$ \n\\frac{d^2 x_i}{dt^2} = \\sum_{j=1}^N \\frac{G m_j (x_j-x_i)}{\\left|x_j-x_i\\right|^3},\n$$\nwhere $x_i$ is the position vector of body $i$, $m_i$ is the mass of body $i$, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $N$ is the number of bodies in the system.  \nTypically, this is rewritten as a set of $6N$ first-order ODEs.\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\frac{dx_i}{dt} & = & v_i \\\\\n\\frac{dv_i}{dt} & = & \\sum_{j=1}^N \\frac{G m_j (x_j-x_i)}{\\left|x_j-x_i\\right|^3}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere the $v_i$'s are the velocity vectors.  \n\nIn this exercise, you will compare the results of integrating these equations using multiple different algorithms and parameters.  We'll start with simple integration algorithms that one could easily code on their own, but then progress to more sophisticated integration algorithms that would require a fair bit of work to implement oneself.  In order to allow you to focus on the main point of this exercise, we'll use Julia's [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl).  The package has [good documentation](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/stable/), but I'll provide nearly all the code you need to do the calculations.  Your job is to read through the code enough that you can tell what it's doing, to think about what you expect to happen, and then compare your expectations to the actual results.  If you read over the code, it may help you start to get comfortable with julia programming, but you don't need to worry about every little bit of syntax for now.  \n\nFirst, we need to write a function that computes the derivatives of each of the positions and velocities."
