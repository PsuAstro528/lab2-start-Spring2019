First, I'll provide some code for the simplest possible model, one where the star has no planets and its true velocity is a constant.  I'll do it in a way that lends itself to generalizing.  Then you'll write code for a model with one planet on a circular orbit.  Then, you'll compute the likelihood of the observations a few different ways."

If a floating point number is equal to an integer, then it's generally ok, but I think it's better to always be cautious about testing floating  point numbers for equality.

In Jupyter or Atom (and probably many other IDEs), you can get unicode characters like $\\simeq$ by typing `\\approx<tab>`.

        "## Model for Radial Velocity of a Star with a Planet on a Circular Orbit \n\n### Create a type to contain model parameters\nA model to describe the radial velocity of a star with planet will require more model parameters.  We could simply use an array of floating point values.  But that can be risky, since it would be easy to confuse the order of parameters.  One way to help reduce the chance of such a bug is to define your own custom type.  In addition to storing data, making it a type will make it possible for the compiler to recognize errors (if you try to pass a variable of the wrong type to a function) and to optimize functions.  \n\n(Another advantage of a custom type is that it can aid reusability of code, even if low-level details are refactored long after the original code was developed, if the custom type is accessed via a set of documented functions, rather than by accessing its contents directly.  We'll come back to this later.)  \n\na.  Write a [composite type](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/index.html#Composite-Types-1) named `rv_model_circ` that consists of the orbital period, radial velocity amplitude of the star, the time of the star's maximum radial velocity and the star's time-averaged radial velocity.

In this case it would be `rv_model_circ(Float,Float,Float,Float)`.  The order of the function arguments matches the order of the types when the user defined the type.  Often, most of the variables have different types, and this can work well.  However, when there are several variables with the same type, this can be a little dangerous.  It would be easy for someone to confuse the order of the parameters (or even the choice of parameterization).

        "As we've just seen, Julia allows there to be multiple functions with the same name.  The choice of which function to call is determined by the type of the variables passed to the function.  Julia features \"multiple dispatch\", meaning that the choice of what function to call depends on all the function arguments, rather than just the first one.  Multiple dispatch can be powerful for allowing programmers to write generic and highly optimized code.  \n\nTo harness that full power it is useful to use a functional programming paradigm.  However, Julia can also be used to express object-oriented programming patterns, that may be more familiar/comfortable to programmers used to traditional object-oriented languages (e.g., C++, Java, Python).  As one example, if you like the pattern of using an \"object\", then you can \"overload\" the parenthesis operator for a user-defined composite type.  The syntax for \"overloading\" the () operator isn't obvious, so I've provided the shell below.\n\nc.

        "### Add Assertions\n\nSometimes a programmer calls a function with arguments that either don't make sense or represent a case that the function was not originally designed to handle properly. The worst possible function behavior in such a case is returning an incorrect result without any warning that something bad has happened. Returning an error at the end is better, but can make it difficult to figure out the problem. Generally, the earlier the problem is spotted, the easier it will be to fix the problem. Therefore, good developers often include assertions to verify that the function arguments are acceptable.  \n\nFor example, in `generate_simualted_data` above, we included assertions that the size of the arrays for observations times measurement uncertainties matched.  We also checked that there was at least one observation.  \n\nd.  What are the preconditions for your your function `rv_model_circ(time)`?  \nUse these to motivate assertions for your function overloading the `()` operator for `rv_model_circ`.  Update your code to include at least one assertion for each input parameter.\n\n### Write unit tests for your function\ne.

One way to reduce the risk of such bugs is to have an comprehensive set of unit tests that are applied _automatically_ each time a developer commits a change.  If some new codes causes a test to fail, we want to know that promptly, so it can be fixed and before it causes scientists to lose time running the buggy code or trying to interpret results of a buggy code.\n\nThe '.travis.yml' file provided in this repository already provides instructions for [Travis-CI.com](https://travis-ci.com/) to automatically run tests each time you commit changes and push them to GitHub.com.

Add your tests above to `tests/test3.jl`, so that they become part of your repository's _continuous integration_ testing. \n\n### Testing the assertions!\nIn this case, the assertions are probably pretty simple.  But sometimes, the assertions can be complicated enough that you'll need to test that they're working as intended!
