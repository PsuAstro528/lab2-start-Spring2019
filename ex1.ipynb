        "# Astro 585 Lab 2, Exercise 1\n\n## Benchmarking Code\n\n\nJulia provides several tools for measuring code performance. Perhaps the simplest way is using the [`@time`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.0/base/base/#Base.@time) or [`@elapsed`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.0/base/base/#Base.@elapsed) macros, such as"

        "The `@time` macro prints the time, but returns the value of the following expression. The `@elapsed` macro discards the following expressions return value and returns the elapsed time evaluating the expression. There are even more sophisticated macros in the [BenchmarkTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl) package which provides `@btime` and `@belapsed` that provide outputs similar to `@time` and `@elapsed`, but take longer than @time, since it runs the code multiple times in an attempt to give more accurate results.  It also provides a `@benchmkark` macro that provides more detailed information.  \n\na) For several common mathematical functions, calculate how many million evaluations your computer performs per second.  \nTry a few arithmatic operations, a couple of trig functions, and a logarithm.
