# Astro 528: Lab 2

Before starting this lab, make sure you've successfully gotten setup to use git, Jupyter, Julia.
The previous lab contained detailed instructions for using the Jupyter notebook server.  

Remember, that you need follow the provided link to create your own private copy of this lab's repository on GitHub.com.   See the

## Exercise 1:  Benchmarking Code, Big-O notation, Compute vs Memory Limits
### Goal 1: Benchmark functions accurately
### Goal 2:  Predict cost of an algorithm based on Big-O notation
### Goal 3:  Identify real world complications that affect scaling

From your Jupyter notebook server, work through ex1.ipynb.  

## Exercise 2:  Numerical Stability of N-body Integration
### Goal 1:  Integrate differential equations
### Goal 2:  Compare the accuracy of results as a function of time step, order and algorithm
### Goal 3:  Recognize importance of numerical stability


From your Jupyter notebook server, work through ex2.ipynb.  


## Exercise 3:  Model for Radial Velocity of a Star
### Goal:  Write effective tests for floating point calculations
### Goal:  Reduce risk of bugs by using composite types and named function parameters
### Goal:  Catch problems early by adding assertions
### Goal:  Implement continuous integration testing
### Goal:  Calculate the likelihood of simulated observations accurately
### Goal:  Validate code via both visual and quantiative tests

From your Jupyter notebook server, work through ex3.ipynb. For this exercise, you will also edit 'test/test3.jl'.
